The 2022 crypto crash was the sector’s first credit crisis and led to a period analogous to the Great Depression. It exposed a system built on opaque, uncollateralized leverage—primarily servicing prop trading firms with reliable cash flows, but also hedge funds with much more volatile P&Ls. Some hedge funds became the first floating bodies as credit became scarce. The rest is history.
<br>
<br>

Fast forward to today, and a quieter, more robust on-chain credit market is emerging. After years of protocol-level hardening, uncollateralized lending is not only viable but has potential that extends far beyond trading firms. Many of DeFi’s leading protocols have matured into businesses with stable, predictable cash flows. Yet, they remain credit-starved, relying exclusively on *equity*—their native tokens—to fund operations and growth.
<br>
<br>

I posit this overwhelmingly defensive capital structure is no longer fit for purpose.
<br>
<br>

The reason mature protocols with positive revenues have favored token buy-backs over ambitious growth projects is a direct consequence of their unsustainably high cost of capital. When a protocol’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is composed entirely of high-risk equity, its investment hurdle rate becomes prohibitively high, shrinking the universe of acceptable projects to near-zero.
<br>
<br>

By finally tapping into debt markets, established DAOs can fundamentally re-architect their financial policies, slash their WACC, and unlock a new, more ambitious chapter of growth.
<br>
<br>

We’ll make our case by focusing mostly on Aave, a leading DeFi protocol. Most conclusions will generalize to comparable businesses. Furthermore, we’ll only detail the ideas we introduce. Feel free to harness LLMs to understand financial jargon such as WACC and Cost of Equity.
<br>
<br>


# **Estimating the Cost of Token**
<br>

We first pin down each token’s baseline return with the equity-market CAPM—risk-free rate plus its S\&P 500 beta times the [4% implied ERP](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histimpl.html).
Because crypto swings harder than stocks, we then tack on an extra spread equal to the Bitwise-10/S\&P 500 volatility ratio minus 1, scaled by the same ERP:

$$K_e = R_f + \beta_{S\&P}\,\text{ERP} + \left(\frac{\sigma_{\text{BITW}}}{\sigma_{S\&P}}-1\right)\,\text{ERP}$$
<br>

This heuristic patches CAPM’s blind spot on idiosyncratic risk. A quick sanity check helps our case: it would be hard to argue that an $80 billion listed firm should still clear a lower hurdle rate than a $3 billion protocol.

<div class="aside">
Readers keen on a token-level Fama-French (Nobel-Prize lineage) are welcome to reach out. For the more curious, the implementation is <a href="https://github.com/sfyll/crypto-capm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
</div>

Our model yields:
* ≈ 24 % cost of equity for Uniswap and Aave
* 15.5 % for Coinbase

<br>

Our 24% equity hurdle is almost certainly conservative. It ignores all Fama-French and crypto-specific factors. Nonetheless, this floor estimate will make our analysis more compelling.

<br>

# **The Equity-Only Trap**

<br>

Because **Aave is 100% equity-financed, its cost of equity *is* its WACC**. Any new project must beat that lofty bar to add value, which is why the protocol has defaulted to recycling cash into token buy-backs.

<br>

Using the [TokenLogic revenue dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/revenue):

<dl class="key-value-list">
  <dt>Annualized revenues</dt>
  <dd>$$\frac{\$50,864,081}{174} \times 365 \approx \$106.8 \text{ m}$$</dd>

  <dt>Annualized expenses</dt>
  <dd>$$\$63.3 \text{ m}$$</dd>

  <dt>Net profit</dt>
  <dd>$$\$106.8~\text{m} - \$63.3~\text{m} = \$43.5~\text{m}$$</dd>
  
  <dt>Net margin</dt>
  <dd>$$\frac{\$43.5\text{m}}{\$106.8\text{m}} = 41\%$$</dd>
</dl>

The operating metrics are impressive; few protocols can match a 41% net margin. Yet, at a \$4b market capitalisation, the **ROE is barely 1%**. As such, each dollar used for buy-backs purchases an earning stream of just one cent per year, while token-holders require twenty-five cents. Buy-backs therefore destroy value; reallocating cash to higher-return projects is the rational alternative.

## <em>Aave V4: a superior use of cash</em>

<br>

The V4 upgrade—dubbed the “largest budget in Aave DAO history” in a [governance thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aavenomics-implementation-part-one/21248)—required a mere **\$13 m**. Assume it lifts revenue a modest **10%**:

<dl class="key-value-list">
  <dt>Incremental revenue</dt>
  <dd>$$0.10 \times \$106.8\,\text{m} = \$10.7\,\text{m}$$</dd>
  
  <dt>Incremental profit</dt>
  <dd>$$0.407 \times \$10.7\,\text{m} \approx \$4.35\,\text{m}$$</dd>
  
  <dt>Project-level ROE</dt>
  <dd>$$\frac{\$4.35\,\text{m}}{\$13\,\text{m}} \approx 33.5\%$$</dd>
</dl>

Even under a punitive 24% hurdle, the V4 upgrade delivers a project-level return exceeding 30%. This confirms that attractive reinvestment opportunities exist; they are simply starved of appropriately priced capital. Aave’s treasury policy should prioritise funding these initiatives and, when equity proves too costly, rely on debt—a long-proven strategy in traditional finance.
<br>
<br>


# **Lessons from a Leveraged World**
<br>

This is a problem that traditional finance solved long ago. No mature, public company operates on a 100 % equity-funded balance sheet. Introducing debt is a standard tool for optimizing capital structure and lowering WACC.
<br>
<br>

This might sound like financial jargon, but it has real-life implications.
<br>
<br>

Two recent examples from traditional markets illustrate this playbook:
<br>
<br>

<ul class="list--spacious">
  <li>
    <strong>Ørsted</strong>: As the Danish utility scaled its UK offshore wind farms, it shifted its capital strategy from pure equity funding to a 50 % <em>farm-down + project-bond</em> stack. The company explicitly notes this model:
    <blockquote>"has reduced the cost of financing our projects significantly... and lowers the overall cost of capital."</blockquote>
    This lower WACC was the direct catalyst for committing to over 9 GW of new builds—more than doubling their installed capacity. <a href="https://orsted.co.uk/clean-growth/financing-the-biggest-offshore-wind-farms-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Netflix</strong>: After securing an investment-grade credit rating in mid-2024, Netflix immediately issued $1.8 billion in debt. CFO Spence Neumann stated the purpose was to gain:
    <blockquote>"balance-sheet flexibility [that] lets us keep reinvesting in the business."</blockquote>
    This flexibility, enabled by cheaper debt financing, was directly linked to their ability to commit over $1 billion to a new production hub—a long-term growth investment.
  </li>
</ul>

A balanced capital structure isn’t only an offensive tool—it also provides defence. Moderate leverage works as a poison-pill: it consumes the borrowing capacity that would otherwise tempt an acquirer. With reliable cash flows, an asset-light model and zero debt, Aave is almost a textbook acquisition target for leveraged-buyout funds. As the expected returns on such a deal rise, traditional investors will eventually find it worth clearing the legal hurdles to take control. That is unless Aave pre-emptively loads its own balance-sheet with cheaper debt.
<br>
<br>

# **Conclusion**
<br>
Crypto protocols began life equity-only; that safety blanket has become a strategic straitjacket.
<br>
<br>

Mature, cash-flow-positive DAOs now face a weighted-average cost of capital north of 20 %, throttling any project that can’t clear that bar. Their unlevered balance-sheets also leave them exposed as attractive acquisition targets.
<br>
<br>

On-chain, unsecured debt is therefore more than an incremental DeFi innovation—it is the unlocking mechanism for the sector’s next growth phase. By blending even a modest slice of debt into their treasuries, incumbents can slash WACC, widen the set of positive-NPV projects, and compete not only with one another but with traditional-finance peers.
