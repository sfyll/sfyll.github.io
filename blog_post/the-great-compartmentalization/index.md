The longest reign just came to a halt. Queen Elizabeth had lived through a lot of the pieces that came to define our present. From the seeds of WWII to the fall of the Berlin Wall, From the Great Inflation to the Great Moderation, or from the Great Collaboration to the Great Disentanglement? Is the Queen’s death foreshadowing a gathering storm, a seismic shift in the global world order, yet so carefully constructed over the past century.
Let’s submit ourselves to an exercise. By looking at history, we will try to answer if the current events are representative of a periodic and temporary pressure release, or the depiction of a more profound, structural change.

## **The Global Trade Construct** 
<p></p>
<br>
The global socio-economic construct is a core pillar of the Great Stability, a period of stable growth and low inflation that has characterised most of the past two decades. Under that arrangement, The dominance of China and Germany as world manufacturers accelerated, while the rest of Europe and the US absorbed most of these goods. 
<p></p>
<br>
Germany and China strengths are built on extreme competitiveness given the relatively low margins of their export sector. Hence, private companies, with the help of the state, have maintained their leading positions by muting cost increases: low raw materials cost, little salary growth and higher levels of production to leverage on economies of scale.
<p></p>
<br>
To maintain a comparative advantage, government involvement was crucial. Remember, China and Germany business model relied on exports. For their products to remain relatively cheaper to the rest of the world, it was key to prevent their currencies from appreciating, and as such they obliged. 
<p></p>
<br>
From now on, let’s focus on Germany as China’s end-goal was the same, but the strategic tools were slightly different. As these are accessible on the web, let’s not crowd out our study.

The graphic above shows real exchange rates. As you can see, Germany has in real terms the weakest performing currencies, except for the French franc. Under a free-floating currency regime its massive current account surplus, and consequential demand for its currency should make it more expensive, allowing its economy to gradually rebalance between exports and imports. The formula to get the real exchange rate is the following:
<p></p>
<br>
- Nominal exchange rate x (Foreign CPI/Domestic CPI)
<p></p>
<br>
Since all euro countries share the same nominal exchange rate and foreign CPI, Germany could only impact its domestic CPI. To do so, Germany reformed its job market between 2002-2005, lowering the natural rate of unemployment and observed unemployment (cf Agenda 2010, Hartz reforms). In layman’s terms, they increased the offer of labour and decreased its labourer rights, hence making its workforce cheaper all else equal.

Without salary increases, there is drastically less potential for rising household spending. As you can see above, Agenda 2010 was a successful operation in weakening labourers’ rights as labour shifted to more precarious employment terms. Consequently, Germany role as a manufacturer grew until they ran the largest trade balance globally, in nominal terms up to 2021.

This has led to a strong and rising current account surplus.
<p></p>
<br>

  <img src="./blog_post/the-great-compartmentalization/Germany current account to GDP.png" class="padded" />

It’s key to understand that a current account surplus goes hand in hand with a build-up of net claims on non-residents. Indeed, if we vulgarise the current account as the flow of goods and services, this must be matched by balancing financial flows illustrating payments for the consumed goods and services.
<p></p>
<br>
Now you’d ask, where would both Germany & China invest circa $300B dollars per annum (let’s not mention Japan here LoL)? On the foreign side of affairs, they both became major creditors.

The above is Germany net international investment (NII) position as % of GDP. Re-investing national earnings in foreign countries allows global exporters to maintain their status-quo by suppressing their currencies appreciation and allowing their main market, foreign lands, to further consume via credit creation. Please note that we won’t delve into Germany NII split between recipient countries, i.e. US and European members, as that’s lengthy enough to justify another study.
<p></p>
<br>
Each country by trying to cope with the unstoppable global flow of goods, services and capital reinforced a process of malinvestment. While China was trying to stimulate domestic demand through tremendous investments in real-estate, Germany was shoving even more money in its export sector, already amongst the most competitive worldwide. Each investment led to marginally lower returns, until these became unprofitable, leading to a local saving glut as other forms of investment weren’t incentivized to remain competitive. Hence, that further increased investment flows abroad, namely to the US. As the US was also trying to stimulate local demand, it chose the same path as China and money was propelled into the real estate sector. Again, the ever-decreasing marginal returns prospect made this investment unprofitable except by involving more leverage.
<p></p>
<br>
Ultimately, this pursuit resulted in capital flowing from countries with high returns on capital to countries with low such returns. This overall process was coined the Global Saving Glut. It depreciated global real rates and was hardly solvable because of the prisoner-dilemma characterising global economic cooperation. Indeed, it is very hard for any country to curb this process alone, even if acting from within the centre. Trying to raise rates to reduce domestic demand (for the US, UK) and as such the trade deficit, if done in isolation, would almost certainly result in a higher exchange rate and more global purchasing power, self-defeating the purpose behind the process. When facing this dilemma in 2002, Eddie George, then governor of the BoE, stated: “So in effect we have taken the view that unbalanced growth in our present situation is better than no growth – or as some commentators have put it, a two-speed economy is better than a no-speed economy”.

As such, trying to solve a global problem with domestic policies was not enough to reach the inflation target. Not only this, but it is characteristic of a boom-bust cycle as the reinforcing mal-investment practice will get abruptly cleaned out by a period of higher rates. Nonetheless, the longer the global imbalances are allowed to run, the more painful the bust process. Furthermore, this process is bounded by global demand, and as such manufacturers will not be able to sustain ever-rising growth by shoving goods and services into other countries. It is also true that stronger supra-national institutions could have solved the prisoner-dilemma, characteristic of global cooperation.

## **From Globalisation to Compartmentalization**
<p></p>
<br>
Since the Bush administration historical trespassing of supra-national entities by unilaterally waging war on Iraq, and the shockwave sent by the GFC, globalisation has ceased to expand on both the political and economical front. By looking at global trades in proportion to global GDP, globalisation surely lost steam, but did it reverse?

Reminiscent of the Bretton Woods era, the IMF, World Bank and WTO seem to be nothing more than relic pertaining to an ancient world. 
<p></p>
<br>
The IMF quotas allocation gives each country voting power representative of its global economic importance. Nonetheless, this process has been blocked since 2010. The US, having an effective veto power, was the only country voting against otherwise universally agreed-on reforms. Meanwhile, China still ranks third in quota allocation, at almost a third of the US share. In addition, after witnessing the economic harm that came with any rescue package from the IMF, most developing countries chose to take their own medicine by parking a chunk of their capital account surplus into foreign-denominated assets, namely American sovereign bonds. At the same time, the Paris Club is falling into irrelevance as China bilateral lending to finance the belt road initiative also bypassed the IMF medicine (cf recent, more accommodative debt waiving by China).
<p></p>
<br>
The WTO advancement stalled jointly with the Doha Development Round, in 2001. The noble goal to lower trade barriers to facilitate global trading, essentially a further expansion of previous reforms, was slightly skewed in favour of developing countries. As such, two irreconcilable clans formed, namely US, EU, Canada and Japan vs India, Brazil, China and South Africa. As any agreement became out of reach, the negotiations broke down in July 2008 and the round was declared dead in 2018. In 2018, Trump also applied tariffs to both his less-favoured counterparties and closest allies, namely China and Europe (amongst others). That not only reversed decades of lowering global trading costs but was met with symmetric responses. 
<p></p>
<br>
The covid crisis exacerbated protectionism by not only forcing countries inwards to safeguard their own interests, but also by revealing how intertwined and fragile was the global supply chain architecture. This led to a global reshoring push, which will obviously lower productivity in the short run while allowing for more national security. This deglobalization push was drastically accelerated by Russia war to Ukraine and the consequential western response. When the West froze Russian assets, it sent a cold chill to eastern countries. Since then, the practice of using part of one’s country current account surplus to buy US debt was halted; bilateral agreements were made to use other currencies than the dollar in settling cross-border trades; and the western-eastern scission has become more acute.
<p></p>
<br>
Ultimately, the conflicting goals entailed in global economic cooperation are best characterised by the so-called policy trilemma, which represents the incompatibility between democracy, national sovereignty, and economic integration. Europe is clearly the best example of policy trilemma. During the sovereign debt crisis, national sovereignty, mostly for the debtor countries, was subdued to maintain democracy and economic integration. In today’s energy crisis, it could well be economic integration that pays the price as populism readings are as high as during the pre-war (WW2) period according to Bridgewater Research. Indeed, the political elite at the centre of Europe lacks democratic legitimacy and as such is bound to cause division across the eurozone, especially during tumultuous times, but that’s a topic to explore in another conversation.

 
## **Conclusion**
<p></p>
<br>
 
The global economic construct is under threat, facing waves of deglobalization, or world compartmentalization. Major economies such as Japan, South-Korea and Germany built their strength around a hyper-connected world, thereby slashing their input costs. 
<p></p>
<br>
Given the direction and velocity of compartmentalization, if not isolationist waves, it appears that the global manufacturers supplying the world with savings (and goods) will face commensurable margin pressures. Optimistically, two decades of mal investments must be recognized, and a higher rate environment will make sure they are. 
<p></p>
<br>
While over the longer-term, liberating misallocated capital will free the world economy from its throttled growth, it might cause significant political pressures over the shorter horizon. Germany domestic policy ultimately shifted production home and unemployment to the rest of the eurozone, with some southern regions facing up to 50% unemployment rates. Hence, populist talks might easily gain traction and clash against Europe, as its centre expanded on a strategy willingly harming the periphery. Revanchist discourses might grow in popularity as the previously decried periphery counterbalance the cratering German current account.
<p></p>
<br>
Additionally, the world is again faced with a Thucydides Trap, and while the Human is an ever-evolving body learning from its own history, empiricism has over-time not been favourable to peaceful resolution during episodes of great power being challenged by a rising force. Hence, decreasing collaboration between the two great world powers could further aggravate potential pain in an open conflict, consequentially making it more likely.
<p></p>
<br>
Ultimately, the recent acceleration in world compartmentalization and the resulting economic difficulties might become reflexive as they allow populists to gain access to political powers across the globe. The now two-decades old globalisation plateau seems to have given way to a deglobalization trend, hence transforming it into a structural issue. Thus, as the current cooperation links are being re-shuffled, it is primordial to look for shifts in remnants of democratic regimes since the threat they’re facing will become yet more acute.
