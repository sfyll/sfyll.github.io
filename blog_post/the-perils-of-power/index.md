In the late 19th century, a period of industrial expansion and unfettered capitalism in America gave rise to the so-called "Robber Barons." Among them, John D. Rockefeller and his company, Standard Oil, stand out as a textbook case of laissez-faire economics gone awry. Starting as a small refinery, Standard Oil swiftly became an oil colossus through strategic partnerships, technological innovation, and savvy business tactics. As the company burgeoned, however, it reached a point where its market share and influence became so enormous that it essentially controlled the American oil industry.

By then, Rockefeller couldn't resist, and succumbed to the allure of monopolistic power. As such, Standard Oil's monopoly strangled competitors, manipulated pricing, and even influenced political decisions, eroding the free market it had initially thrived in. Eventually, this led to the advent of antitrust laws, notably the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, aiming to rein in the monopolistic tendencies that had been left unchecked for too long.

Lido, on the contrary, hasn't yet leveraged the dark side of the power it earned by obtaining a significant chunk of the staking market. Nonetheless, there is no inherent defensive mechanism which would put lido in check, were it to use monopolistic power to seal its lead on the market, and expand its tentacles to other sectors.

Actually, this monopolistic state seems to be the base case, rather than the exception. As blockchains epitomize the laissez-faire system, the natural equilibrium within this space tends toward monopoly insofar as the consensus rules are respected. As we know, monopolies often lead to negative externalities. Take Uniswap, for example, which holds a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share#:~:text=Uniswap%20is%20the%20market%20leader,the%20decentralized%20crypto%20exchange%20space." target="_blank">66.1% market share in spot trading</a>. Consider also that just <a href="https://mevboost.pics" target="_blank">4 relays or 3 builders</a> handle most blocks. Metamask dominates most non-algorithmic transactions; one oracle <a href = "https://defillama.com/oracles" target="_blank"> secures roughly 50% </a> of all oracle secured value; and <a href = "https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending" target="_blank"> two lending protocols</a> account for the vast majority of all lent/borrowed TVL, and so forth.

Furthermore, there is some form of perverse relationship. Indeed, as blockchains grow, they become ossified, making each incremental change harder to push, and as such any defense against monopolistic behaviour less likely. The decision process's binary nature further exacerbates the ossification process. Unfortunately, the social consensus must be able to agree on the entirety of any upgrade for it to happen. This ultimately leads to some form of paralysis as a ravine is created between negotiating parties. Meanwhile, monopolies can grow powerful enough so that they are the only parties able to bridge the ravine, ultimately dictating what the consensus rules are. Indeed, we've observed public attempts to dictate the consensus rules on the largest blockchain, Bitcoin. The Segwit2X proposal served as a notable example, where UASF acted as a last-ditch effort to prevent its implementation.

Ultimately, it seems that we must break debates into pieces, so that they can be both constructive and actionable. Furthermore, we need a bridging mechanism to translate an expressive, offchain debate settlement into its binary representation that can be absorbed by the blockchain itself. Obviously, this part is non-trivial, as it is akin to building some form of codified law decree which can be interpreted by the blockchain. At the same time, the decree codification must be dynamic enough so that it can survive the passage of time. Furthermore, one would have to define what constitutes a "vote". This requires careful calibration. A too loose definition would incentive sybil-attacks, whereas a too strict definition could lead, again, to monopolistic tendencies.
<p></p>

Finally, thanks to the advance of new technologies, we can now build with greater expressiveness than we could some years ago. For example, most offchain compute is now capable of being absorbed by the blockchain as they are compressed into input/ouput and proofs. At the same time, there has been little effort in enhancing the onchain integration of the social layer while some parties have reached a mass big enough to manipulate that component. Consequently, it stands to reason that discussions surrounding the architecture of such systems ought to be initiated by members of the Ethereans Assembly. Such discourse should occur before monopolistic tendencies become dangerously entrenched, ultimately leading to the potential hijacking of the social layer, and by extension, the blockchain itself.
